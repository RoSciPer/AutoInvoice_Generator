Latvian Version (Optional Addendum)

### 🇱🇻 Latviešu  
Šī programma ģenerē rēķinus no PDF failiem dažu klikšķu veidā.  
Iepriekšējā procesā (manuāla datu kopēšana) bija:  
- Liels kļūdu risks  
- ~5 minūtes vienam rēķinam  

Tagad: **30 sekundes** un rēķins gatavs!  
Key Adjustments:
Focus on time savings (before/after comparison)

Added dependency list for easy setup

Included screenshot placeholder (replace with actual image later)

Optional Latvian section (delete if unneeded)

Want me to tweak anything? For example:

Add a GIF demo?

Include error handling details?

List planned features?

This README positions your tool as a time-saving specialist tool rather than just another PDF parser. 🚀

🏁 Final Note
Optimized for Latvian CSDD Vehicle Registration Certificates
This tool works out-of-the-box with standardized PDFs from Latvia's CSDD (Ceļu satiksmes drošības direkcija) vehicle registry, but can be adapted to any structured document by modifying the text extraction patterns in pdf_parser.py.

Since you're using **Win32GUI** instead of PyInstaller to create your Windows executable, here's the polished README.md section with clear instructions and technical specifics:
